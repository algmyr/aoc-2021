Code from learning rust during Advent of Code 2021.

Not sure how idiomatic any of the code is. For many days I went onna tangent to explore something in rust, like implementingbindexing traits for a struct, or making my own iterator.

Most focus was put to solve the problems with a reasonable algorithm and ok performance (sum of runtimes is <1s). Other than that I tried to keep the code sensible as I would in other languages.
